                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under 
                    the age of 18 years old that are diagnosed with a disability.
                    <br>After years of supporting various well known kids charities, 
                    Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group of 
                    individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of 
                    donations being used to cover overheads instead of going to the ones 
                    who need it most, the Kids.</p>

            <section style = "width: 33%; display: inline-block;">
                <h3>What We do</h3>
                <p>With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used 
                    for the children, with the running costs and overheads kept to an 
                    absolute minimum and looked after by the Directors and friends.
                    <br>Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have provided 
                    over 150 grants covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised 
                    clothing and other assistance to these very special kids.</p>

                <h3>Fundraising</h3>
                <p>We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity
                     of Directors, individuals, corporations, estate trusts and through 
                     various yearly fund raising activities.These includes the Mercedes Benz 
                     Polo Championships held each September and a Brisbane Businessman’s lunch 
                     held each November.<br>Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian 
                     Taxation Office endorsement in May 2001 to allow donations over $2 to be 
                     tax deductible.</p>

                opportunity to share my opinion in my community. It’s very hard to have your 
                voice heard, but when you do I feel it has a great impact.
